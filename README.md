Important factors to diagnose the Alzheimer
CDR (Reflecting the presence or absence of dementia). 
The global CDR is based on a standard scoring algorithm which integrates functioning in six individual domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. 

Global CDR scores
0=normal cognition; 
1=mild dementia, 
2=moderate dementia, and 
3=severe dementia. 
CDR 0.5 designates “uncertain dementia” 


MMSE score is less sensitive to cognitive impairment so we are not using it
